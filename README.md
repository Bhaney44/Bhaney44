# About Me

I am an inventor. 

It is an amazing time to be alive when we have access to artificial general intelligence on the Internet. 
AGI means we have the power to solve any problem.
As an inventor, my focus is on solving problems with mechanisms, machines, and formal processes.

You can learn more about me on [BrianHaney.org](https://www.brianhaney.org/).
I also have a publication list on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=2&user=6_XhYkQAAAAJ).

# Book
